Description: Methods for spatial risk calculations. It offers an efficient approach to determine the sum of all observations within a 
    circle of a certain radius. This might be beneficial for insurers who are required (by a recent European Commission regulation) to determine 
    the maximum value of insured fire risk policies of all buildings that are partly or fully located within a circle of a radius of 200m. See 
    Church, R., ReVelle, C. (1974) <https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01942293> for a description of the problem.
