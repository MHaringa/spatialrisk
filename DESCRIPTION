Description: Methods for spatial risk calculations. It offers an efficient 
    approach to determine the sum of all observations within a circle of a 
    certain radius. This might be beneficial for insurers who are required (by 
    a recent European Commission regulation) to determine the maximum value of 
    insured fire risk policies of all buildings that are partly or fully located 
    within a circle of a radius of 200m. See  Church (1974) 
    <doi:10.1007/BF01942293> for a description of the problem.
