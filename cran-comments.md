## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Columns with longitude and latitude of centroid of polygon added to data sets.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.1
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs. 

## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of spatialrisk.
All packages that I could install passed.
