## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* `plot_points()` now returns a warning when a specific provider tile is not available

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.3.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs. 

## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of spatialrisk.
All packages that I could install passed.
